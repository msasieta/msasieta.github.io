### Paper 1  
**Title:** Duality and Axion Wormholes

**Authors:** Edward Witten

**Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01587>

**Comments:**

- Four dimensional Euclidean wormholes exist in Einstein gravity and a 2-form field B_{μν} (embeddable in string theory). This theory is expected to be dual to Einstein gravity and an ``axion'' \phi (U(1)-valued scalar) under Dirac quantization conditions.

- The wormhole solution is semiclassical in the 2-form frame but it is non-semiclassical in the scalar description (this can be argued from dimensional analysis of couplings).

- In a fixed background the paper argues that this is reasonable because the partition functions in the two frames in a wormhole background is related by Poisson resummation of fluxes. 

- The paper derives the low-energy bi-local effective action induced by the axion wormhole (i.e. integrating out the wormhole contribution) in both frames. Can one think of this action in holography as the fundamental interaction between holographic systems needed to stabilize the Euclidean wormhole?

### Paper 2  
**Title:** More About the Spontaneous Breaking of Time Reversal in de Sitter Space

**Authors:** Leonard Susskind

**Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01666>

**Comments:**

- The paper argues that an ``observer'' in de Sitter space may be anything which breaks time-reversal symmetry. This essentially fixes the puzzle that T-odd operators of de Sitter static patch have a semiclassical expectation value in the Hartle-Hawking state.

- Spontaneous symmetry breaking only makes sense at infinite volume.
