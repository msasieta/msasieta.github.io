### Paper 1  
**Title:** Duality and Axion Wormholes

**Authors:** Edward Witten

**Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01587>

**Comments:**

	-	Four-dimensional Euclidean wormholes exist in Einstein gravity coupled to a 2-form field B_{\mu\nu} (which can be embedded in string theory). This theory is expected to be dual to Einstein gravity coupled to an axion \phi (a U(1)-valued scalar), under appropriate Dirac quantization conditions.
	-	The wormhole solution is semiclassical in the 2-form description but non-semiclassical in the scalar description, as can be argued from dimensional analysis of the couplings.
	-	In a fixed background, the paper argues that this mismatch is nevertheless reasonable, since the partition functions in the two descriptions, evaluated on a wormhole background, are related by Poisson resummation over fluxes.
	-	The paper derives the low-energy bilocal effective action induced by axion wormholes (i.e. after integrating out the wormhole contribution) in both descriptions. In AdS, can this long-distance effective action be interpreted the other way around, as a fundamental interaction between holographic systems required to stabilize the Euclidean wormhole?

### Paper 2  
**Title:** More About the Spontaneous Breaking of Time Reversal in de Sitter Space

**Authors:** Leonard Susskind

**Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01666>

**Comments:**

	-	The paper argues that an “observer” in de Sitter space may be any system that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. This is proposed to resolve the puzzle that T-odd operators in the de Sitter static patch have semiclassical expectation values in the Hartle–Hawking state: the observer is assumed to carry a clock that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, it is not made concrete how this occurs dynamically, or why such spontaneous symmetry breaking should take place.
	-	Strictly speaking, spontaneous symmetry breaking only occurs in the thermodynamic limit. Does this require the observer to have a parametrically large entropy?
