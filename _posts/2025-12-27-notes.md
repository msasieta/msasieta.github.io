### Paper 1  
**Title:** Probing Stringy Horizons with Pole-Skipping in Non-Maximal Chaotic Systems

**Authors:** Ping Gao, Hong Liu

**Link:** <https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20700>

**Comments:**

- Interesting paper on pole-skipping and its relation to fast scrambling in non-maximally chaotic systems.
- In Rindler--AdS, the CFT Regge trajectories determine the Lyapunov exponent of the Rindler horizon (the CFT thermal state on the hyperboloid at $\beta = 2\pi$) through the leading Regge trajectory. The pole-skipping points for fields of different spin determine the Regge trajectories and hence the Lyapunov exponent. At infinite coupling, only the stress-energy tensor is exchanged, leading to maximal Lyapunov behavior. At finite coupling, an infinite family of higher-spin fields is exchanged (stringy modes). The argument of the paper is that these lower the leading Regge trajectory and thereby determine a non-maximal Lyapunov exponent. This suggests that pole-skipping points for individual fields are not directly related to the non-maximal Lyapunov exponent; rather, it is the collective set of pole-skipping points across different fields that matters.
- A nice point is that stringy (but classical) horizons continue to have the same symmetries for each of the fields.
- Studied in large--$q$ SYK chain.
