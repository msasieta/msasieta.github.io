I’m broadly interested in quantum gravity, holography, and many‑body quantum chaos. Current directions include:

## Typical interior geometry from randomness
How ensembles of Brownian evolutions generate wormholes and black‑hole microstates; path‑integral saddles, overlaps, and Hilbert‑space dimension estimates.

## Python’s Lunch & reconstruction
Quantitative conditions for “lunches” to form and their relation to code subspaces, complexity bounds, and tensor‑network models with computational covariance.

## Entanglement structures in AdS/CFT
Replica geometries, baby universes, and constraints from modular flow, with applications to information recovery.
