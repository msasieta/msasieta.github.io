# Martin Sasieta
*Postdoctoral Researcher, Quantum Gravity*

Welcome! I study quantum gravity, black holes, wormholes, and holography (AdS/CFT), with a focus on randomness, Brownian circuits, entanglement, and complexity. This site collects my papers, talks, teaching, and notes.

- See **[Research](/research)** for current projects and interests.
- Browse **[Publications](/publications)** with links to arXiv.
- Find materials under **[Talks](/talks)** and **[Teaching](/teaching)**.
- Grab a one‑page **[CV](/cv)**.
