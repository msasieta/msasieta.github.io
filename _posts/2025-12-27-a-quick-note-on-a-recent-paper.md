**TL;DR:** Interesting idea, but the interior interpretation feels underconstrained.


### Paper 1  
**Title:** Something about interiors  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX  

- Nice idea connecting interior volume to entropy.
- Feels very semiclassical; unclear what survives nonperturbatively.

### Paper 2  
**Title:** Another recent preprint  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/YYYY.YYYYY  

- Conceptually clean.
- The state-counting interpretation feels ambiguous.
